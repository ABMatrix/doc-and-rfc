## What is ZK-Meta?
ZK-Meta is a privacy protection computing framework developed by X-Matrix Labs.
In essence, ZK-Meta is a Web3.0 privacy protection infrastructure that aims to protect user and business data
in lieu of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
ZK-Meta provides customized privacy preserving solutions suitable for various businesses.
In addition, ZK-Meta offers pre-optimized technical selections and solutions.
Currently, ZK-Meta includes Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) protocols such as ZK-3D and ZK-Rollup.

## What goals is ZK-Meta trying to accomplish?
ZK-Meta has a modularized design that fully embraces operability and configurability.
With ZK-Meta, you can get a full package with the most secure, reliable and pluggable
privacy-preserving services with formidable cryptographic support.
Finally, ZK-Meta ensures that data is censored, trackable, verifiable and not tempered with.

## What makes ZK-Meta so special?
The ZK3D protocol of ZK-Meta realizes value transfer in a setting where data is fully private.
This protocol is capable of performing 4 arithmetic operations, range proof and size comparison on encrypted data.
There are 4 outstanding features of the ZK3D protocol:
1. Straightforward: no overhead on user operations; no additional knowledge is needed to use the protocol;
1. Decentralized: users fully own their data without compromise;
1. Fast: proofs are generated and verified within milliseconds;
1. Secure: rigorous cryptographic proof.

In addition, the ZK-Rollup protocol of ZK-Meta utilizes the most up-to-date PLONK ZKP algorithm as PLONK does Trust Setup for only once.
The top 3 features of the ZK-Rollup protocol are:
1. Extremely low transaction fees;
1. Trustless protocols;
1. Cryptographically secure, similar to the Ethereum mainnet.
