## What is ZK-Meta?
ZK-Meta is a privacy protection computing framework developed by X-Matrix Labs.
In essence, ZK-Meta is a Web3.0 privacy protection infrastructure that aims to protect user and business data
in lieu of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
ZK-Meta provides customized privacy preserving solutions suitable for various businesses.
In addition, ZK-Meta offers pre-optimized technical selections and solutions.
Currently, ZK-Meta includes Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) protocols such as ZK-3D and ZK-Rollup.

## What goals is ZK-Meta trying to accomplish?
ZK-Meta has a modularized design that fully embraces operability and configurability.
With ZK-Meta, you can get a full package with the most secure, reliable and pluggable
privacy-preserving services with formidable cryptographic support.
Finally, ZK-Meta ensures that data is censored, trackable, verifiable and not tempered with.

## What makes ZK-Meta so special?
The ZK3D protocol of ZK-Meta realizes value transfer in a setting where data is fully private.
This protocol is capable of performing 4 arithmetic operations, range proof and size comparison on encrypted data.
There are 4 outstanding features of the ZK3D protocol:
1. Straightforward: no overhead on user operations; no additional knowledge is needed to use the protocol;
1. Decentralized: users fully own their data without compromise;
1. Fast: proofs are generated and verified within milliseconds;
1. Secure: rigorous cryptographic proof.

In addition, the ZK-Rollup protocol of ZK-Meta utilizes the most up-to-date PLONK ZKP algorithm as PLONK does Trust Setup for only once.
The top 3 features of the ZK-Rollup protocol are:
1. Extremely low transaction fees;
1. Trustless protocols;
1. Cryptographically secure, similar to the Ethereum mainnet.

## ZK-Meta Achitecture
* **Core layer**
  the core layer is built on top of the newest theoretical breakthroughs of Zero-Knowledge-Proof (ZKP)
  such as optimizations of performance, trust setting and security,
  all of which will be published in academic papers.

* **Platform layer**
  a platform where wallets with novel features can be developed to support features
  such as privacy-preserving or offline transactions
  that include multi-party signing and are adaptable to multiple blockchains.
  On the platform, you can improve the current ZKP toolkits as well as their documentation.
  Similar concepts are borrowed from the ZK-Sync and AZTEC projects.
  The platform has its own value exchange protocols to leverage privacy-preserving data.
  In addition, the platform can perform 4 arithmetic operations and logic comparisons on the encrypted data.
  The main features of the platform include the following:
    1. Straightforward: no overhead on user operations; no additional knowledge is needed to use the protocol;
    1. Decentralized: users fully own their data without compromise;
    1. Fast: proofs are generated and verified within milliseconds;
    1. Secure: rigorous cryptographic proof.

* **Application layer**
  captures the latest market trend and supports fast prototyping.
  In a short term, this layer aims at Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) and anonymous auction.

## What is X-Matrix Labs?
X-matrix Labs is an R&D team passionate about Cryptography, blockchain, and math.
The team consists of researchers from prestigious institutes and professionals from engineering and financial industries.
Our mission is to build a decentralized network to empower Web 3.0.
We focus on Open Finance, Cross-chain Compatibility, and privacy-preserving transparency.
We aim to empower the Web 3.0 networks by making the network smoother, more secure, and more boundaryless.

## What are X-Matrix Labs's focuses?
### Gateway
We aim to build gateways among data, digital assets, and smart contracts to maximize the value of data through blockchain technologies and eventually to make Web3 smoother.

### Privacy
X-matrix Lab has industry-leading cryptography and privacy research lab to provide ZKP-based solutions for Web3.\
Users take full ownership of their private data in a trustless setting.

### De-Fi
Stone Protocol is the only yield management protocol focused on creating *Rock Solid Yield* for all users in the DeFi ecosystem.
X-Matrix Labs is dedicated to building the next-generation cross-chain DeFi protocols on top of the Substrate framework.
We aim to boost the value flow between multiple platforms and create *Rock Solid Yield* for millions of users.

### Storage
X-Matrix Labs has sufficient experience in distributed file systems such as IPFS and Filecoin to empower our data storage systems.
